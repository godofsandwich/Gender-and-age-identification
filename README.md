# Gender-and-age-identification
This is a college project done in my 6th semester of my Undergradguate program. 

The basic gist is that I replicasted a model named 'Perigender' proposed by Md Hussain et al and and was able to replicate their results for gender classification of the periocular region
inspired by this performance I attempted to recreate the same results for age classification using the same model (only the output layer was changed). This did not get desirable results. As a results I am currently working on improvin gthe performance.
